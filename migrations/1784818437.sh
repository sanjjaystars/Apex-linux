echo "Gate sudo and polkit fingerprint auth behind the lid state (password when the lid is shut)"

# Existing fingerprint setups have pam_fprintd first in /etc/pam.d/sudo and
# /etc/pam.d/polkit-1 but no lid gate, so a closed-lid sudo or pkexec would
# block on the unreachable reader for the full pam_fprintd timeout before
# offering the password. Insert a pam_exec gate before pam_fprintd that skips
# fingerprint while the lid is closed. New setups already get this from
# apex-setup-security-fingerprint.
#
# The gate points at the fixed /usr/bin path the apex package always
# provides, so it keeps working across package installs and dev-link (which
# overlays $APEX_PATH but leaves /usr/bin untouched). pam_exec needs a
# literal absolute path — it does not expand env vars.
